"""
DESCRIPTION: Audio engine learning model prototype.
The idea relies in wavelet decomposition of the incoming sound signal.
As well known, the Wavelet Transform and its inverse can provide the weights of 
any signal. Thus - in idea, getting the weights the satisfy the equation at the 
TF Wave Level and classify it in a micro scale.
